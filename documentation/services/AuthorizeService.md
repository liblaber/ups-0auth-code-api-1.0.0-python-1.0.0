| [authorize_client](#authorize_client) | The Authorize Client endpoint initiates the OAuth Authorization Code flow by redirecting the user to UPS for logging-in and authorize the client application. To begin the authorization flow, the application constructs a URL using the application's client Id, the redirect URI, the scope of permissions requested, and a random string used for subsequent verification. A successful response redirects back to the client with an authorization code that can be exchanged for an access token. |
